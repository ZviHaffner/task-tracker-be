## Setup of Environment Variables

`.env.*` files have been set to be ignored by Git. Therefore, new `.env` files will have to be created to set up the environment variables required for the project to run.

Here are the steps to create and configure these files:

1.  Create a `.env.test` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

PGDATABASE=<database_name>\_test

2.  Create a `.env.development` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

PGDATABASE=<database_name>
